1. Image Classification with the MNIST Dataset

Demonstrating the ability to recognize handwritten numbers.

2. Image Classification of an American Sign Language Dataset

Demonstrating the ability to recognize ASL iamges. Testing results approach 100% while Validity results show overfitting issues.

3. Convolutional Neural Networks

Greatly improved on overfitting issue. Validation scores still slightly worse than Training.

4. Data Augmentation

Fixed overfitting issue with augmented data. Randomly applied flips, rotations, cropping, and brightness/contrast changes.

5. Pre-Trained Models

Using VGG16 network on the ImageNet dataset, to determine which animal is attempting to go through the doggy door (only dogs allowed in and out), and then, to identify a specific dog among others (Bo).
